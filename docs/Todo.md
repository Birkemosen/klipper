There are several features still to be implemented in Klipper. In no
particular order:

Host user interaction
=====================

* See if there is a better way to report errors. Octoprint sometimes
  doesn't highlight an error (one has to look in the terminal tab to
  find the error) and errors written to the log can be non-obvious to
  a user.

* Improve gcode interface:

 * Provide a way to temporarily disable endstop checks so that a user
   can issue commands that potentially move the head past
   position_min/position_max.

* Improve logging:

 * Possibly collate and report the statistics messages in the log in a
   more friendly way.

* Possibly support a mechanism for the host to limit maximum velocity
  so that the mcu is never requested to step at a higher rate than it
  can support.

Safety features
===============

* Support loading a valid step range into the micro-controller
  software after homing. This would provide a sanity check in the
  micro-controller that would reduce the risk of the host commanding a
  stepper motor past its valid step range. To maintain high
  efficiency, the micro-controller would only need to check
  periodically (eg, every 100ms) that the stepper is in range.

 * Possibly support periodically querying the endstop switches and use
   multiple step ranges depending on the switch state. This would
   enable runtime endstop detection. (However, it's unclear if runtime
   endstop detection is a good idea because of spurious signals caused
   by electrical noise.)

Testing features
================

* Complete the host based simulator. It's possible to compile the
  micro-controller for a "host simulator", but that simulator doesn't
  do anything currently. It would be useful to expand the code to
  support more error checks, kinematic simulations, and improved
  logging.

Documentation
=============

* Add documentation describing how to perform bed-leveling accurately
  in Klipper. Improve description of stepper phase based bed leveling.

Hardware features
=================

* Port to additional micro-controller architectures:
 * Smoothieboard / NXP LPC1769 (ARM cortex-M3)

* Support for additional kinematics: scara, etc.

* Possible support for touch panels attached to the micro-controller.
  (In general, it would be preferable to attach touch panels to the
  host system and have octoprint interact with the panel directly, but
  it would also be useful to handle panels already hardwired to the
  micro-controller.)

Misc features
=============

* Possibly support a "feed forward PID" that takes into account the
  amount of plastic being extruded. If the extrude rate changes
  significantly during a print it can cause heating bumps that the PID
  overcompensates for. The temperature change due to the extrusion
  rate could be modeled to eliminate these bumps and make the
  extrusion temperature more consistent.
